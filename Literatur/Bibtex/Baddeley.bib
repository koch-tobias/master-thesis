  abstract = {From the Publisher: This book deals with a new and expanding area of neuroscience that provides a framework for understanding neuronal processing. This framework is derived from a conference held in Newquay, UK, where a group of scientists from around the world met to discuss the topic. This book begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of information theory and then illustrates these concepts with examples from research over the past forty years. Throughout the book, the contributors highlight current research from the areas of biological networks, information theory and artificial networks, information theory and psychology, and formal analysis. Each section includes an introduction and glossary covering basic concepts. This book will appeal to graduate students and researchers in neuroscience as well as computer scientists and cognitive scientists.},
