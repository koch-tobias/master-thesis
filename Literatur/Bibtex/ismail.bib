  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the key underlying technology of the Internet of Things (IoT); however, these networks are energy constrained. Security has become a major challenge with the significant increase in deployed sensors, necessitating effective detection and mitigation approaches. Machine learning (ML) is one of the most effective methods for building cyber-attack detection systems. This paper presents a lightweight ensemble-based ML approach, Weighted Score Selector (WSS), for detecting cyber-attacks in WSNs. The proposed approach is implemented using a blend of supervised ML classifiers, in which the most effective classifier is promoted dynamically for the detection process to gain higher detection performance quickly. We compared the performance of the proposed approach to three classical ensemble techniques: Boosting-based, Bagging-based, and Stacking-based. The performance comparison was conducted in terms of accuracy, probability of false alarm, probability of detection, probability of misdetection, model size, processing time, and average prediction time per sample. We applied two independent feature selection techniques. We utilized the simulation-based labeled dataset, WSN-DS, that comprises samples of four internal network-layer Denial of Service attack types: Grayhole, Blackhole, Flooding, and TDMA scheduling, in addition to normal traffic. The simulation revealed promising results for our proposed approach.},
